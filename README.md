last update because all functions are moved into separate mods that will be uploaded on steam in a few days.
its basically easier to maintain, easier for people to find, no unnecessary restarts to apply settings
i will put the list of mods here... if i dont forget

this update does some stuff, dont remember what exactly but some stuff i made before moving everything into separate mods.
