outdated mod that did STUFF. 

STUFF includes:
- architect menu overhaul based on docworld - moved into Docworld+ Architect Menu
- duplicate animal remover - moved into Duplicate Animal Remover
- infinite turrets - moved into Infinite Turrets
- rottable filter - moved into Rottable Filter
- stuffable stone floors - moved into Stuffable Floors XML Edition
- buildable/makeable ideo stuff - moved into Styles Unleashed
- convert building styles to texture variations - moved into Styles Unleashed
- most other stuff moved into tests patches

TLDR most STUFF got moved into separate mods. Those can be found on steam.
