# Rimworld-TPatches
Many fixes, tweaks, settings and mod compatibility patches. Everything is toggleable. Made using XML Extensions!

It is a framework which allows me to add new toggleable patches into mod settings with as little effort as just writing a patch.

## Content
- duplicate animal remover
- ideology styles to VTE texture variations converter
- stuffable stone floors
- filter for rottable items
- enormous designation category overhaul based on DocWorld
- many small fixes, tweaks and balancing changes, for example: buildable ideology stuff, infinite turrets, VAE Accessories rebalance

By default all fixes are enabled, all tweaks and balancing changes are disabled. You can enable/disable any feature in this mod using XML Extensions mod menu.

**Loading order** - load as low as possible, just above the performance mods.

## Compatibility
- Should be compatible with everything if you load it as low as possible.


## Bugs
- Rottable filter isn't perfect and might contain some non-rottable food item, but only meals, so they fit in a fridge anyway.
- Disabling VFE Mechanoids designation category can cause a supposedly harmless red error. Something is still trying to access that category, but if I don't delete it, ther is just nothing there, and there is no XML referencing it.

## Info
Requires [XML Extensions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574315206).

Imranfish's XML Extensions is an incredible modding tool, using it I made a "framework" which automatically creates a fancy setting entry for each patch I make. If you have any suggestions, I can now very easily implement them into the mod.


Load as low as possible!

To access settings menu, go to rimworld settings and press the "More Mod Settings" button which is added by XML Extensions.
